Goethe revised his work in 1799 for theatrical performance; his revised version was an epic poem of more than 500 hexameters. 'Advertisement' to the present work remarks: 'The Public are already acquainted with the Poem of Herman and Dorothea; written by the celebrated Goethe, and translated into blank verse by Mr. Holcroft. It is replete with beauties of every kind: but the extreme simplicity of manners and of incident, which prevails throughout, is a defect in the eye of some English readers; who have not been accustomed to see the common occurrences of life written in the language of the Muses. This consideration occasioned the present translation, in prose, to be undertaken' (pp. iv&ndash;v). Thomas Holcroft's verse translation was first published in 1801.
