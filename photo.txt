the daguerreotype. (from the spectator.). An invention has lately been made public in paris that seems more like some marvel of a fairy tale or delusion of necromancy than a practical reality: it amounts to nothing less than making light produce permanent pictures, and engrave them at the same time, the course of a few minutes. the thing seems incredible and, but for indisputable evidence, we should not at first hearing believe it; it is, however, a fact; the process and its results have been witnessed by M. Argo, who reported upon its merits to the Academie des Sciences. To think of nature herself reflecting her own face, though but as “in glass darkly,” and engraving it too, that we may have copies of it! This looks like superseding art altogether; for what painter can hope to content with nature in accuracy or rapidity of production? But nature is only become the handmaid to art, no her mistress. Painters need not despair their labours will be as much in request as ever, but in higher field; the finer qualities of taste and invention will be called into action more powerfully; and the mechanical process will be only abridged and rendered more perfect. What chemistry is to manufactures and the useful arts, this discovery will be to the fine arts; improving and facilitating the production, and lessening the labour of the produced not superseding his skill, but assisting and stimulating it. The following particulars of this beautiful and extraordinary invention are gleaned principally from fragments of the report of M. Arago, quoted in the communications of the foreign correspondents of the atheneum and the literary gazette, and partly from private information. The apparatus consists of a camera obscura, with the superaddition of an engraving power: in lieu of the white disc on which the moving picture of external objects is reflected by the rys of light, a metal plate is substituted, covered with a particular coating, on which the light forms the image by its action thereon. M. Daguerre, the inventor, “has found a substance” says M. Arago, “more sensible to light than the chlorate of silver, which is altered in an inverse manner— that is to say, it leaves on the several parts of the object, dark tints for the shadowy, half-tints for the lighter parts, and no tint whatever for the tints that are luminous,” when this action of the light on the different parts of the plate has produced the desired effect, it is arrested at once by a particular process, and the plate may be exposed to the full light of day without undergoing any change. The appearance of the monochrome picture has been compared to mezzotint engravings, deep-toned aquatint, or the etchings of Rembrandt. The length of time required for the process varies with the state of the atmosphere and the quality of the light; moonlight is slower in its operations than sunlight; and on a every dark day the engraving —or, to speak more correctly, the etching— requires a longer time; but twenty minutes seems to be the maximum under unfavourable circumstances: in ordinary weather eight or ten minutes is the average, “but under a pure sky like that of Egypt”, says M. Arago, “perhaps one minute might suffice to execute the most complex design. As it is continued stream of light that acts upon the metal, fixed objects can only be delineated: “The foliage of trees” again, to quote M. Arago. “From it's always being more or less agitated by the air, is often but imperfectly represented. In one of the views, a horse is faithfully portrayed, except the head, which the animal had never ceased moving: in another a decanter (shoe black), all but the arms, which were never still.” The slight or occasional motion of objects does not, however, invalidate the process: for, says the Athenfjkhjk correspondent, “in one view of the Boulevard du Temple, taken from M. Daguerre’s own residence, a coach and horses are introduced with the most literal and linear exactness”. But it is obvious that the views produced by these means will only be pictures of still life: inanimate objects, buildings, mountains, rocks, and tracts of country, under settles aspects of the atmosphere, whether it be the bright glare of noon, the even down pour of rain or the cold moonlight, will be pictures with an accuracy of form and perspective, a minuteness of detail, and a force and breadth of light and shade, that artists may imitate but cannot equal. The precision and exactness of the effect of the pictures may be judged from these facts: The same bas-relief in plaster and in marble is differently represented, so that you can perceive which is the image of the plaster and which of the marble; you may almost tell the time of the day in the out-door scenes. Three views of the Luxor Obelisk were taken, one in the morning, one at noon, and the other in the evening,and the effect of the morning light is distinctly discernable from that of the evening, though the sun’s altitude and consequently the length of the shadows are the same in both. But what the lifeless, monotonous, and cold reflections of the camera, when applied to motionless objects, are to the living reality, with all its magic harmonies of colour, will be the monochromes produced by the graphic camera to the glowing pictures, which, by the combined operation of skill and genius, arrest and fic on the canvass the evanescent beauties and ever-varying forms of animated nature as seen through the medium of the painter's imagination. We have not seen on impression of these light-created monochromes, but we venture to predict that they will present an appearance of shadowy insubstantiality combined with the rigidity and fixedness of a mode, which will, after the first blush of novelty, pall upon the eye, and render them only valuable as models for the painter’s use; as it is, they require his touch to vivify and, in some instances, to complete them. The reflection of a head in the camera lucida looks like an exquisite miniature in wax work; and sleeves taken with the camera have a fixedness peculiarly unpleasant because they are deprived of the ethereal medium of the atmosphere, the want of which is so sensibly elt in the pictures of some clever but mechanical minded painters. We make these remarks not to disparage the value of a discovery the most remarkable in the history of art, nor assuredly, to deprecate the ingenuity and perseverance of the inventor; but for the two-fold purpose of calming the apprehensions of the more humble class of artists, who may fancy that their occupation's gone, and of preparing our readers not to expect the beauties of Rembrandt’s chiaroscuro in the engravings produced by the Daguerreotype. The process is simple, and readily available to all personal and the machine is so compact, that M. Daguerre has stood upon the bridges of Paris using it without attracting much notice from the passengers. Its utility to travellers, in delineating any curious objects of architecture, machinery, costume, and furniture, is at once apparent. The influence of the invention on painting will be very great, and, we think, beneficial also; the increased exactitude of delineation super induced by its use will make people more critical; in their a recitation of the verisimilitude of pictures, and painters will find a much higher degree of correctness required of them in the delineation of living forms and moving objects; pictures will become more true and more animated, for every artist will be eager to escape the reproach of a mere copyist of the Daguerreotype. We hail this important discover, therefore, as on equally valuable to art as the power-loom and steam engine to manufactures, and the drill and steam-plough to agriculture. M Daguerre is well known as the collaborator of M. Bouton in the production of the beautiful illusory pictures of the Diurnal ad it was in the course of his experiments in producing their effects of light and shade that he made the wonderful discovery he ha mature with such complete success. it has occupied his attention during fifteen years, and its progress to perfection has been very gradual; owing principally, we understand, to the difficulty of procuring such an amalgam of metals as would be operated on by the rays of light permanently: at first he could only get the rays to remain for a few seconds, then he was enabled to retain them for half a minute, next for a minute, and so on until a few years ago he fixed them for ten minutes. “The earlier sketches, or reflections rather,” sas the Athenaeum, “which he made some years since, have a slight degree of haziness: this defect he has now entirely overcome.” M Daguerre’ pursuit of this discovery has been the talk of the ateliers in Paris for several years; but no artist having yet seen any results it was regarded as a delusion, like the search for the philosopher’s stone, or perpetual motion; the indefatigable inventor, who neglected his painting and looked more like a blacksmith than an artist, was compared to the aleh mists of old: he may now turn the laugh against the incredulous. It is said that he offered his invention to the French Government for 300,000 francs, and pending the result of the negotiation, he does not of course make his secret known. He has, however, an agent in London who is receiving subscriptions for the machine.

 ‘principle of the daguerreotype. At a meeting of the academy of sciences at paris, on' monday 19th inst., m. argo, in the presence of a crowded audience, divulged the secret of m. daguerre’s invention, which has now become public property. the following is an abstract of the report: 'm. arago stated, that, according to m. daguerre's process, copper plated with silver is washed with a solution of "nitric acid, for the purpose of cleansing its surface, and especially to remove the minute traces of copper, which the layer of silver may contain. this washing, must be done with the greatest care, attentions and regularity m. daguerre has observed, that better results are obtained from copper plated with silver, than from pure silver whence it may be surmised, that electricity may be concerned in the action.. after this preliminary preparation, the metallic plate is exposed, in a well closed box, to the action of the vapour of iodine, with certain precautions. a small quantity of iodine is placed at the bottom of the box, with a thin gauze between it and the plate, as it were,  to sift the vapour, and to diffuse it equally. it is also necessary to surround the plate a small metallic  frame, to prevent the vapour of iodine from condensing in larger quantities round the margin than in the centre; the whole success of‘ the operation depending on the perfect uniformity of' the layer of ioduret of silver thus ' formed. the exact time to withdraw the sheet of plated copper from the vapour, is indicated by the plate assuming a yellow colour. m. dumas, who has endeavoured to  ascertain the thickness of this deposit, states that it cannot be more than a millionth part of a millimetre. the plate thus prepared is placed in the clerk chamber of the camera obscura, and preserve with great care from the faintest action of light it is in fact, so sensitive, that exposure for a tenth of a second is more than second is sufficient to make an impression  on it. .at the bottom of the dark chamber which m. daguerre has reduced to small dimensions, is a plate of round glass, which advances or recedes until the image of the object to be represented is perfectly clear and distinct. when this is gained, the prepared plate is  substituted for the ground glass, and receives the impression of the object. the effect is reduced in a very short time. when the metallic plate is withdrawn,  the impression is hardly to be seen, the action of a second vapour being necessary to bring it out distinctly: the vapour of mercury is employed for this purpose: it is remarkable that the metallic plate, to be properly acted upon by the mercurial vapour, must be placed .at a certain angle. to this end, it is  enclosed in a third box, at the bottom of which is placed a small dish ﬁlled with mercury. if the picture is to be viewed in a vertical position, as is usually the case with engravings, it must receive the vapour of mercury at an angle of about 4.5 deg. if, on the contrary, it is to be viewed at that angle, the plate must be arranged in the box in a horizontal position. the .volatilization of the mercury must be assisted by a temperature of 60 dog. (of reaumur.) after these three operations for the completion of the process the plate must be plunged into a solution of hypo-sulphite of soda. this solution acts most strongly on the parts which have been uninﬂuonccd by light; the reverse of' the mercurial vapour, which a tracts exclusively that portion which has been acted on by the rays of light. from this it might perhaps be 'imagined that the lights are formed by the amalgamation of the silver with the mercury, and the shadows by the sulphuret of silver formed by the hypo-sulphite.m arago, however formally declared the positive inability of the combined wisdom of physical, chemical, and optical science, to offer any theory of these delicate and complicated operations, which might be even tolerably rational and satisfactory. the picture now produced is washed in distilled water to give it that stability which is necessary to its bearing light without undergoing any further change. after his statement of the details of‘ m. daguerre’s discovery, m. argo proceeded to speculate upon the improvements of which this beautiful application of optics was capable. He adverted to m. dagurre’s hopes of discovering some further method affixing not : merely the images of things, but also of their colours; a hope based upon the fact, that, in the experiments , which have been made with the solar spectrum, blue color has been seen to result from blue rays, orange colour from orange, and so on with the others. sir john herschel is sure that the red ray alone is without action the question arose, too, whether it will be possible to take portraits by this method? m. argo ‘was disposed to answer in the affirmative. A serious difficulty, however, presented itself entire absence of motion on the part of the object is essential to the success of the operation, and this is impossible to be obtained from any face exposed to the inﬂuence of so intense a light. m. daguerre, however, believes that the interposition of a blue glass would in no way interfere with the action of the light on the prepared plate, while it would protect the sitter sufficiently from the action of the light. the head could be easily ﬁxed by means of supporting apparatus. another more important desideratum is, the means of rendering the picture unalterable by friction. the substance of the pictures executed by the daguerreotype is, in fact, solid — is so slightly deposited on the surface of the metallic plate, that the least friction destroys it, like a drawing in chalk; at present, it is necessary to cover it with a glass from his numerous experiments on the action of light on different substances, m. daguerre has drawn the conclusion that the sun is not equally powerful at all times of the day, even at those instants when his height is the some above the horizon. thus, more _ satisfactory results are obtained at six in the morning than at six in the afternoon. from this, too, it is evident that the daguerreotype  is an instrument of exquisite sensibility for measuring the different intensities of light, a subject which has hitherto been one of the most difficult problems in natural philosophy. it is easy enough to measure the difference in intensity between two lights viewed simultaneously, but when it is desired to compare daylight with a light produced in the night — quiet of the sun, with that of the moon. for example — the results obtained have had no precision. ‘ the preparation of m. dagncrré is inﬂuenced even by the light of the moon, to which all the preparations ' . hitherto tried were insensible, even when the rays were concentrated by, a powerful lens. '  in physics, m.'arago indicated some of the more immediate applications of the daguerreotype, independently of‘ those which he had already mentioned in photometry . he instanced some of the most complex phenomena exhibited by the solar spectrum. we know, for example, that the different coloured rays are separated by black transversal lines, indicating the absence of. these rays at certain parts and the question arises. whether there are also similar interruptions in the continuity of the chemical rays? m. arago proposes as a simple solution of this question, to expose one of m. daguerre's prepared plates to the action of a spectrum  an experiment which would prove whether it is continuous or interrupted by blank spaces.

The daguerrotype in london. we are happy to be able to announce that the beautiful invention of m. daguerre is now in program of arrangement for exhibition in this city; and that we have seen with our own eyes a fulfilment of the promised wonders of which we have all heard and read so much. the apparatus is in the hands of m. de ste. croix, a voyageur artiste. who is intent on depicting the principal buildings and most celebrated scenery of great britain and ireland. his present apartment in piccadilly is only suited to a private and very imperfect exposition of the powers of  his instrument; for its range is there limited to a few well smoked “elevations" on which the sun does not shine (being at the wrong side of the street). and. what was still more, mal a propos. a shower of rain fell during the time of its performance. the result was. however, truly admirable; and we could well imagine how much more brightly and strongly defined the lights and tints would be if assisted by brilliant and uninterrupted sunshine' directed on the object. the process of m. daguerre has been so fully and so recently described that we need not repeat it, and shall only mention brieﬂy that m. de ste. croix follows it precisely — first presenting his silvered copperplate to the vapour of cold iodine; then placing it from it) to 20 minutes in the focus of a camera obscura. adjusted to the selected prospect; afterwards exposing the faintly tinted surface. at an inclination of 45 degrees, to the vapour of mercury. which ( heated to degrees of centigrade) developes “the picture of light." he ﬁnally ﬁxes the delicate effects by washing the plate with hyposulphite of soda. the picture produced on the polished silver surface by these means is one of the most  curious and beautiful objects of art that we have ever beheld. it is seen with all the truth and beauty of nature, m,  with the additional charm of brilliant con centration similar to that which is furnished by an opera glass and (still more wonderful) with a soft tint of blue in the sky. the aerial perspective is exquisite. and the m portrayed with a degree of delicacy and harmony superior to anything pictorial ever presented to our eyes. m. de ste. croix assures us that the extent and distance ol the landscape does not present any impediment to the soccer of his operations, and that  the prospect of paris taken from the pont neuf by m. daguerre is quite as perfect as that taken across the street or across the table. the capacity of the daguerreotype for doing justice to an “interior" was pleasingly illustrated by a mirrored sketch of the artist‘s own table. with basin. ewer, towel. &c which the early sunshine had just completed a faithful picture as his visitors entered. from the development of the blue tint on the portrait of the ewer we are led  to believe that this colour is that which (whether in heaven or on earth) possesses most capability of affecting the silvery surface in the daguerreotype. m. de ste. croix does not endeavour to ﬁx an subject on paper, and indeed all photogenic operations hitherto attempted on that material fall far short of the results produced by the method with which he is now fully occupied. we bar  no doubt that all concerned will cheerfully admit so much we were pleased with one expression of opinion uttered in m. de ste. croix's presence by a philosophical instrument maker who has bestowed a great deal of time and pains on the subject (e. m. clarke). and who declared that he would henceforth neither make or sell  any more of his own “photogenic delineators." but would (with the artist's permission). In future, work after his models. we are happy to hear that the daguerreotype is about to be transferred to a site much mori suitable both for operations and exhibitions — to the adelaide gallery of practical science — where arrangements will be made for enabling it s powers to be fully developed by the aid of the brilliant cry hydrogen light to be thrown on statues. carvings, model s, &c. a degree of illumination which it i believed will suffice to attain the wished for result in a very few minutes

On this curious subject the following interesting letter has been addressed to us by Mr. Beatty, the well-known engraver of this town. We have also received by him is extremely singular —to the editor of the news-letter. Sir—being occasionally engaged since the announcement of M. Daguerre's extraordinary invention of fixing on silver plated on copper the minute images of external objects produced by means of the Camera Obscura. After a number of experiments, i was somewhat surprised to find that in using silver paper the effect was different from silver plated on copper, although treated in a similar manner. Silver plated on copper gives the true effect of light and shade, while silver on paper gives the opposite, namely, the light parts of the subject are dark, and the dark shades are in proportionate degree light. In order to convince you of the fact, I send you a specimen but our days of late having been cloudy, you cannot expect it to be as perfect as would wish. I hope before your next publication to be able to submit to you a specimen on silver plated copper and silver on paper, in order that you may more completely understand the difference. Hoping that this communication may have the effect of promoting inquiry on the subject, I remain your obedient servant, Francis S. Beatty.

'While considering (says Mr. Hyde Clark in the Railway Register for April) some of the applications of the electric telegraph to distant purposes, it occurred to me that it was possible to use the electric telegraph, so as to put the daguerreotype in action at a distance. in noting what suggested itself to me, I do so more in reference  to matters of curiosity than of any real utility, but it is sometimes worthwhile to throw out ideas of this kind as they may direct the attention of others to practical and valuable applications, which often arise from the observation of trifles.  It seemed to me that it might be sometimes desirable to have an independent record of the state of railway signals, as a check on the parties having the care of them. This might be accomplished by having a daguerreotype apparatus so placed as to command at a proper focus a view of the required spot, and so that a prepared plate might at a given moment be exposed so as to receive the impression. The apparatus being out of the control of local parties connected or disconnected by means of  the telegraph,, a chief superintendent at a distant station could, at any required time, obtain a fixed record of the  state of the signals, so as on subsequent inspection to have a check on the actions of the local officers. It might also be desirable to obtain a record of the state of a train on its stopping at a station, when a picture of the engine or train while in a state of rest would be obtained, so as to keep a record of the arrangement of the carriages and so forth state of a naval station or of a man-of-war, while in a condition of rest, might also be similarly recorded at the wilt of some distant authority other and better, perhaps practicable applications of this mode of working maybe suggested by those who turn their attention to it, and it is very likely that there are circumstances, in which it may be useful to let parties know that the eyes of superintendents, hundreds of miles away, may be made to see at any given moment, as well as their speech find means of instant communication may here observe that I have been rather surprised that in the applications of electricity which hare lately been made, there has been no attempt to take advantage of the elective capacity which electricity shows in regard to colours, for the purpose of taking impressions. I suggested this as far back as 1838 or 1839 in the second octavo series of the Railway Magazine edited by John Herapath, Esq, and also in some lectures I published on the laws of colour, Want of time and opportunity have prevented me from making any experiments on this subject, but experiments are not necessary to establish what is a well-known general principle. Everyone has been so much occupied with the applications of light and actinism, that the applications of electricity for pictorial purposes have been neglected. It is known by familiar facts that the electric fluid shows an elective capacity for certain colours. Every electrician is in the habit of referring to these as black has an attraction towards heat, so it has a repulsion from electricity,, and as white has a repulsion from heat, so it has an attraction for electricity. The experiments on the masts of ships may he cited as an illustration of the capacity of the electric fluid in reference to colour. In reference to these facts it long since appeared to me practical. and I had conceived a plan to obtain impression of surfaces, j presenting different shades, by an application of these properties of electric fluid.

An excellent lithographic likeness of Terence Bellew M'Manus has just been published by the skilful daguerreotypist, Professor.Glukman, of this city. It is uniform in point of size, style, and execution,, with those admirable portraits of Messrs. O’Brien, Meagher, and others,which have been already given to the public by this enterprising artist. The name of Mr. M'Manus, although not so familiar to the public as those of O’Brien, Mitchel,. Duffy, and the other gentlemen who played a more prominent part in the proceedings of the Irish Confederation, has acquired a considerable degree of celebrity by the recent state trials. The history of this gentleman’s connection with the unfortunate occurrences the south—the rebellion of ’48, as some have termed it—imparts an air of romance and chivalry to his character and conduct which is rarely to be met with in modern times. For many years he had resided in Liverpool, where  he was extensively engaged in mercantile pursuits. But absence from his native land only deepened his sympathy for her sufferings, and strengthened his desire for her regeneration, Possessed of an ample competence, which his talent and  industry had secured to him in that great mart of English commercial enterprise— 184 surrounded  by a large circle of attached friends and universally respected for his honour and integrity—he sacrificed these present advantages, and all chance of future prosperity, to the vain hope of righting, in “battle line” the wrongs under which he conceived his country laboured. In that attempt he has fallen; and, though now lying under sentence of death as a convicted traitor, there are few who will not fee! admiration for the sincerity of the man which his acts have so unmistakably proved. The present portrait is a faithful and spirited likeness of this patriotic gentleman.Were we disposed to be hypercritical, we might remark that the countenance is to some extent devoid of the vivacious animated expression which so peculiarly belongs to Mr. McManus. Nevertheless the tout’ ensemble is very pleasing, and is sufficiently indicative of the frank, daring and enthusiastic character of the original. The drawing which is from the pencil of Mr. H. O’Neill, is very skillfully execute; and , while finished with minute care, it presents the appearance of having been dashed off with great artistic freedom and ease. It may not be out of place to mention, that the daguerreotype from which this likeness has been copied was taken after the conviction of Mr. McManus— Professor Glukman having gone down to Clonmel, at that period, for the purpose of taking portraits of all the state prisoners The numerous friends of Mr. McManus will rejoice to possess this portrait of a man whose qualities in private life were calculated to command respect and whose unselfish but misdirected patriotism has prompted those actions for which he has forfeited his life. Portrait of George Baldwin Esq. Mr. Glukman has also published the portrait of another individual whose political principles and pursuits are widely dissimilar from those of the ill fated gentleman whose likeness we have noted above. We allude to Mr. George Baldwin the well-known freemason, whose portrait is to be seen displayed in the windows of M. LeSage, and other print-sellers. Mr. Baldwin is represented in the full costume of his rank, as Prince Mason; his breast glistens with stars and crosses—the richly embroidered scarf the compass square and other masonic emblems. The likeness is one of the most striking we have ever seen; the artist has caught the peculiar expression of Mr. Baldwin countenance; and on this point it is enough to say that he has accurately transferred to stone one of Professor Gluckman's best daguerreotypes. We have no doubt that this portrait will be extensively purchased by the members of the respectable fraternity, amongst whom Mr. Baldwin holds a high position, and by whom he is much respected.

Lord Byron says, “ This is the patent age of new inventions "— he said this before science had breathed a syllable  of the mysterious word which heads this mortal paragraph. Had he lived in our day, he would have modified a little sarcasm in which the phrase we have quoted is embedded—and the higher powers of his gifted and varied mind would have been taxed to express, in his own peculiar style of lustrous beauty, the wonders which this “ patent age of new inventions was about to place before him. But what Lord byron did not live to see, every inhabitant of Exeter has now placed actually within his reach. A gentleman has opened Photographic Rooms in this good city of Exeter, and there, in the  space of twenty seconds you may get a correct likeness painted by the Sun. Sitting for a portrait has generally been considered the purgatorial passage which precedes the paradise of Ihe picture. It is true that you come out a much better man than you went in; and if the artist be one like oar T. Mogford, he draws you into an expression of the very best mood which your mind is capable of lighting up in your face, and this momentary amiability being caught and fixed upon the canvas—there you are handed down to posterity as placid and amiable, as cheerful and buoyant, as grave  and reflective, as benevolent and humane, as the peculiar fitness of your physiognomy will admit—till the spectator exclaims,. “what a nice, pleasant, agreeable face—who’d have thought that he ever figured in a court of law, cursed the income-tax gatherer, or eluded the gentle tap of the bailiff.” How to catch your mind in it your best dress—and there to fix you, is portrait painting —that is peculiarly the gift of the artist whose name we have mentioned above. But what is Photography Aye, there’s the rub. Photography is the art of miniature portrait painting by the Sun. Chemists had long discovered that light exercised an action on certain substances—the efforts of modern philosophers have enabled them to guide and control this, and by the aid of a plate properly prepared to be subject to this action, you being placed in a chair, with your face such as it is, directed towards a camera—there your image reflected on the plate is, but the action of light, fixed , in the space of about twenty seconds; There is no mistake about the matter you may not look so amiable as you did on the morning of your marriage, nor so miserable as when your friend deceived you—nor so transcendently happy as when a sighing lover at the fear of your yielding charmer, you caught the first faint sign which proclaimed in its tremulous breathings a triumph as certain as if it had been trumpet-tongues—you may not look as you did in either of these specific situations; but just as you looked the very express image which was reflected from your face in that miserable medium of twenty seconds is fixed and may be sent half the world over, to gladden the heart of a distant friend, or cheer the gloom of an absent lover. It is impossible to present a more valuable picture. Criticism is defied, thrust out of court— your eye cannot be misplaced, your nose out of the gravity of its centre; your mouth ill drawn— that is, provided you keep your face still, and subdue your features to a proper degree of subordination—we won’t answer for a twitching and tremulous nose. In this Exeter establishment the art will no doubt be executed in its very best style, as the modus operandi is super intended by on of the patentee’s own men, who, though not exactly the great Beard himself, is no shoveling at the business; but in twenty seconds turns you out upon the wide world with your own natural face, painted in its own natural style, by the light of the blessed sun—for ever.

The powers of a new Portrait painter, the sun, have just been exemplified and introduced in Exeter by Mr. Gill, of Castle Terrace, under license from Mr. Beard, the Patentee of the celebrated Photographic process—a discovery, the completion of which has startled even the scientific world, and the introduction of which has, in a few short months, been attended in the Metropolis and elsewhere with unbounded success—success so brilliant as to be worthy of the glorious agents employed. The God of day, and sublunary Portrait painters, work in different and independent spheres— in the one case man copies nature; and in the other, nature or the great illuminating principle of nature, is made to copy man. The inflexible and unerring fidelity of the Photographic process—the quality which constitutes its surpassing value to persons who desire the precise resemblance of those they love imprinted as we may say, b the very features of the sitter illumined by the light of day—is perhaps, the very circumstance which renders that process a harmless contemporary rather than a rival of the Portrait painter by whose art the blemishes of the features can be disguised at will, and occasional looks which would not bear perpetuation on the canvass, be unnoticed in the artist’s performance. In Photography, on the other hand, the expression of the moment is caught, and delineative accuracy is so certain, that some amount of good humoured expression should be secured before sitting to the mysterious painter in Mr. Gill’s apparently magical Camera. To us, the results attainted by this most surprising of modern inventions appear so valuable, that all person to whom Divine Providence allows relations or friends ot to whom phrenologists allow a bump of self esteem should hasten to register the family archives their precise appearance at this moment, and should find their way to Mr. Gill as soon as they possibly can. This process, if not the greatest marvel, undoubtedly is in its present state and probable future applications, on of the greatest wonders of this fertile age of scientific discovery. The process is absolutely the fixing an image or catching a shadow, and, as is were, rendering permanent in a  mirror the reflection of the features there beheld, without, of course, the natural colours, though they will someday be given. It might diminish the interest, the peculiar delight, with which the effect will be witnessed, were we to describe the process. The theory of Photography in is several forms and prospects cannot be explained without reference to most recondite principles of Science, and the practice is much better seen at Mr. Gill’s rooms than we could describe it. We shall therefore merely state that we cordially wish Mr. Gill all the success which his own enterprise, and the peculiarly valuable character of this wonder working process so richly deserve; and we promise his sitters nothing less than a new pleasure by visiting Mr. gill, whom they will find meritorious and obliging.

lectures on photography mr. robert hunt, of london. delivered the ﬁrst of  a course of two lectures “on photographic phenomena and the practice of the art”  in the lecture theatre of the Royal institution, on Monday sennight. The lecturer observed that the history of photography carried us but a few years back. the camera obscura was invented by baptista porta, in the 16th century which he needed scarcely to explain was a small dark chamber in which there was an inverted image of external objects. It was long desired by artists, after the invention of the camera obscura to obtain some means of ﬁxing the beautiful images formed in that dark chamber. the lecturer then proceeded to notice the alchemical knowledge of the change produced by the solar rays. the ﬁrst scientific notice of any such change being produced was that of the cloride of silver being blackened by the inﬂuence of the sun's rays. scheele. the celebrated swedish chemist was the ﬁrst who observed that this blackcn light was only produced by the blue and violet rays of light. he then explained the refraction or dispersion of the rays as exhibited in the diagrams hung up in the lecture room. it was  scheele who. in the course of his investigations, noticed that the most refrangible of rays — the violet and the bluet  were those which produced a blackening upon the chloride of silver. ritter, loebeck, and others. were led to make investigations as to the chemical inﬂuence of light; and ritter observed that there was a class of rays existing beyond those visible coloured rays. which produced a more decided dent the tint produced by the blue and the violet rays upon the cloride of silver. the ﬁrst experiment which was ever tried for the purpose of using either nitrate of silver or cloride of silver, was made by wedgwood. of etrura. it occurred to him that “ rays of light were allowed to pass through  diluent coloured bodies, they would darken the preparations

photography. in the old time. when magic and witchcraft formed a portion of the social creed of the world, men were talked of who had sold their shadow to the prince of darkness as the recompense for having learned all the mysteries and the occult powers of necromancy and wizard craft. then  michael scottie name and fame, his strifes and triumphs with the arch ﬁend, formed the theme of many a ballad, and was the staple of every story and legend told by the cottage ﬁre during the long nights of winter. then natural philosophy was obscured amid the crudities of alchemy, and the initiated communicated with each other in a mysterious jargon, and wrote down their experiments in a. Cabalistic cypher. men regarded every incident that took place, whether of good or ill luck, as the certain result of beniﬁcent or malign influences, exercised by ignorant old women, or soul-bartered old men. cattle were killed by an evil eye, or children were hag ridden during the middle watches of the night ; and all from the king to the peasant were living in the midst of dangers against which they could provide no armour.  if a ship was sunk at son, a holocaust ol' witches was scarcely sufficient to appease the ignorant fears of the multitude. now. however, the light of science. and a profounder knowledge of the laws of nature, have dispelled the shroud  shadow. and men scarcely wonder at. much less fear. any thing which natural philosophy announces. among the most recent discoveries is that which we have named above. it is making the most intangible of all nature’s agents become the bond slave of man. the photographist, greater than michael scott or peter schlcmil. who only lost their own shadows, can steal the shadows of others: and can so fix them upon his plate of polished silver. that time is scarcely strong enough to obliterate the impression. We remember well when, we believe, the first Photographic picture was exhibited in glasgow. it was from the studio of m. daguerre. the discoverer of the art . which commonly goes by his name, and was in the possession of mr. willis, exchange place. that picture gave the exact representation of the interior of m.daguerre’s own studio. there was a piece of ﬁgured tapestry. a table on which stood a bust of william shakespeare, and some philosophical apparatus, there were also some choirs in the apartment. that picture struck all who saw it with surprise. it was dim, grey, and dreamy. Still the discovery, at hundreds of miles distant from where it was made, was shown to  be visible truth. that work led many who saw it to  anticipate yet more striking and brilliant results. immediately throughout the whole civilised world many scientific persons set to work. m. daguerre's discovery,  was tested, proven,  and improved upon, until at length it has arrived at such astute of advancement that by means of new chemical agents , which render the silver plate more sensitive to the impingement of solar rays, as good a picture can be taken by  the light of a common gas jet as the one we have just alluded to, which was taken under the bright sunlight of paris. it would be out of place here to enter upon a description of the many agents employed or the mechanical means which have been had recourse to, during the various stages of photographic art. the newspaper reading public are more interested in results than in processes. aad we are happy to have it in our power to refer to the works of an artist resident amongst us, namely, mr. bernard. in whose gallery pictures may be seen, which for brilliancy, depth of colour sharpness of outline, and artistic arrangement, will satisfy the most casual observer what photography is capable of achieving. this gentleman, who is full imbued with the spirit of his art — who has the love of an ametuer, and the enthusiasm and perseverance of a scientific investigator has gained results from the daguerreotype which will stand as comparison with the ﬁnest miniatures ever produced by pencil and colour. as to the truthfulness of the likenesses there can only be one opinion. in this the daguerreotype can no more err than a mirror can. but mr. bernard's likenesses are more than still life shadows. they are full of spirit, and many of them are more like the idealised creations of art than works which pass current by that high title. we may remark that mr. bernard has succeeded in producing  larger portraits than any we have before seen; and what is worthy of especial notice is, that contrary to what might have been anticipated, the softness and delicacy of texture is not lost lost by the increased dimensions of the image. another circumstance deserves to be mentioned. that mr. bernard has achieved a great desideratum in photography, namely, by  a process peculiar to himself, he can render his pictures equally brilliant when held at any angle to the light . thus. one grand objection to daguerreotype portraits is obviated. we happen to know that mr. bernard is apparently on the eve of yet more important discoveries. wishing him heartily every encouragement in his very interesting pursuit, we take leave of this subject for the present.

Remarkable instance of photography in forging. A curious circumstance happened on Saturday, which, says the Paris correspondent of the Atlas, may be just as alarming to you as it proved to us. The science of photography has for some time past been the rage amongst the young men of fashion in Paris, and has been carried to a great perfection by many of them, but by none to a greater extent than by M. Aquado, whose successful studies from nature are well known among the artists of every country, On Saturday morning this gentleman sent word to the experts of the Bank of France that he had at length succeeded so fully in the imitation of one of the thousand franc notes that he desired them to detect it, and to show his perfect conviction of the impossibility of discovery he warned them that the note would be presented at the Bank between the hours of one and three. According to this intimation, the whole of the experts were assembled at the caisse and each note brought in was submitted to their examination before it was accepted. The hours passed by, and no false note had appeared the whole of those presented during the interval specified lay in a row spread out before the experts, who already crowded over the idea that M. Aquao had not dared to hazard the experiment, when just as the clock struck three he walked, smiling and triumphant, with a thousand-franc note in his hand. “Well have you detected my forgery?” said he, with the greatest coolness. “No” replied the head expert laughing, “for a good reason—you never sent it” Why, there is lies right under your nose, the third to the left, and here is the original I took it from”. The dismay of the experts may be conceived, when even upon comparing the two they found it impossible to pronounce which was the genuine note, and which the false.On Monday, a committee was held to determine upon the course to be adopted, as, according to report, an immense number of these photographed notes are in circulation and M. Aguado declares himself able to manufacture any quantity in a given time, and that none shall be detected, either by sight or touch. The consternation created by the announcement is not to be described; and the report tells us that the bank has already accepted the offer of a learned English doctor resident  here to furnish a chemical preparation of his own discovery which shall immediately decompose the photography by the touch of a camel’s hair brush dipped in the liquid and passed lightly over the printed lines. The adventure has served to make us laugh, although rather grimly, when it is considered that already, the greater proportion of the notes in circulation may not be able to withstand the test of the learned doctor’s brush.

Mr. William Geary, the eminent photographist, whose success in America, and in various parts of England, as also in Dublin, has been so great, has arrived in Cork, and is about to commence operations at the photographic rooms in patrick-street. We have seen some of the specimens and they are certainly the most beautifully clear and brilliant we have ever seen, possessing a life-like reality in colouring, &c. We recommend an early visit to the rooms.

At a recent meeting of the royal society (we quote from a contemporary), “a paper was read” On the application of photography to the physiognomic and mental phenomena of insanity by H.W. Diamond, M.D. the object of the paper is to show the peculiar application of photography to the delineation of insanity. An asylum for lunatics on a large scale supplies instances of delirium with raving fury and spitefulness —of delirium accompanied with an appearance of gaiety and pleasure in some cases, and with constant dejection and despondency in others —or of imbecility of all the faculties with a stupid look and general weakness. The photographer catches in a moment the permanent cloud, or the passing storm of sunshine of the soul, and thus enables the metaphysician to witness and trace out the connection between the visible and invisible in one important branch of his researches into the philosophy of the human mind. Raving madness is generally accompanied by the forehead being contracted, the eyebrows drawn up, the hair bristled, and the eyeballs prominent, as if they were pushed out of their orbits. Photography, as is evident from the portraits which the author exhibited in illustration of this paper, confirms and extends this description, and to such a degree as to warrant the conclusion that the permanent records thus furnished are at once the most concise and the most comprehensive. There is another point of view in which the value of portraits of the insane is peculiarly marked—viz, in the effect which they produce upon the patients themselves. In very many cases they are examined with much pleasure and interest but more particularly when they mark the progress and cure of a severe attack of mental aberration. After referring in detail to the cases of patients suffering from hopeless insanity, whose portraits accompany dr. diamond’s communication, the author gives the following account of a case in which photography, as he conceives, unquestionable led to the cure —A.D. aged twenty, was admitted under his care in August, 1854, having been recently discharged uncured from Bethlem hospital, after a year’s residence there. Her delusions consisted in the supposed possession of great wealth and of an exalted station as a queen. Any occupation was therefore looked upon by her as beneath her dignity. It was not without great persuasion that this patient was induced to allow herself to be photographed; but when she saw her likeness and was led to converse on the subject of her delusion, an improvement took place, and she was eventually discharged perfectly cured. The author conceives that portraits of the insane may be valuable to superintendents of asylums, not only for their physiological interest, but also in cases of re-admission. It is well know, he observes, that portraits of those who are congregated in prisons for punishment, have frequently been on value in re-capturing some who have escaped , or in proving, with certainty and little expense, a previous conviction. In a similar manner, portraits of the insane who are received into asylums for protection, give to the eye so clear a representation of their case that on their readmission, after temporary absence and cure, the author has found the previous portrait of more value in calling to his mind the case and treatment than any verbal description placed on record. In conclusion, he states that photography gives permanence to those remarkable cases which are types of classes and which are, therefore, of very great interest to the physiologist.

A collection of photographs now exhibiting at Meous Colaghi’s lays claim to more than ordinary excellence. It is usually sufficient for the photographer to produce an accurate resemblance with as few artistic defects as possible. In this case Mr. Fenton is not consistent with merit of avoiding defects, but he too has attempted positive artistic effects, which are always laudable ambitious and very often successful. In this way he has attempted a series of photographic portraits of British artists, with their patron, Prince Albert, at their head. There is decided attempt at given character, not only to the face, but to the position of each individual which goes beyond anything we have yet seen in photography. As they have been artists who have fired their own “pose”. It had all the better chance of being successful, and certainly, notwithstanding unavoidable deficiencies of detail, the result has been most masterly There is a strength and circumstance about the portrait which we have never yet seen in photographs. In addition to these are some lovely views about Bolton abbey, and of a brick house in its neighbourhood are masterpieces. Again, we have old familiar corners if the London parks—perfect in manipulation— and, where ground or buildings are concerned perfect in effect. They are not always successful in the burbage—the ater, as in all photographs wants liquidity—and the shadows are sometimes ill defined and heavy. All this is inherent in the difficulties of the process and the only wonder is, that so much has been overcome. In every other respect that pictures are perfect. Many of the pictures in the room are engraved by the patented process, called photo-galvanograph and invented by a German, Herr Retah, and which, whatever may be its ultimate success, has at least the merits of great ingenuity. A photographic drawing is placed on paper smeared with glue; this after a chemical process leaves an impression in alright relief. This impression is placed on a  second sheet over which gutta percha after having been liquified, have been smeared. The result is a depressed gutta percha plate. This is again taken off upon copper from which the plates themselves are taken. The copper requires generally retouching by hand. One print —that of the Venus de Milo —is shown, taken from a plate not touched and though defective, in yet expressive and true. The process in a cheap one, and there is much delicacy in the page printed from it. It may very probably hereafter be improved into an important branch of the art.

 'We do not make any apology for devoting a few sentences to an art of which the entire community has recognised the  beauty and admitted the value, and which places within reach of the humblest of the land that which formerly was  confined to the healthy—via, a faithful likeness of themselves or of those they love. The science or art was considered of sufficient importance to become the subject of an interesting discussion at the recent meeting of the British Association at Leeds, the debate being principally conﬁned   to the merits of that which is termed the  “dry process” of  photography, and which several of the speakers spoke of as a complete failure, or an exploded bubble. In our own city. the experience of the dry process is quite the reverse, and by means of it the utility of the science has been vastly extended. It is well known that in ordinary circumstances the photographer works alongside of his laboratory, consisting of a large assortment of baths, chemicals, bottles, vessels,  and a copious supply of water, which, as a whole, are, we need scarcely say, very difﬁcult of transport.This process will, in all likelihood, be always followed in the taking  of likenesses and copies where the artist remains in a ﬁxed position in town or village; and nothing can excel it. But in the event of some exquisite bit of scenery being discovered in a spot difficult of access, it may he impossible to remove  it all the varied apparatus necessary for the wet process.  the dry process comes in to solve the difficulty. By this means plates are previously prepared with certain chemicals, and these along with the camera can be transported anywhere, and impressions taken in beautiful spots to which it  will be impossible to remove the laboratory. This process and, indeed, every variety of the photographic science, has been most successfully followed out by our townsman, Mr.  Kibble of Turner’s Court an amateur of great intelligence  and enthusiasm whose apparatus has cost him, we believe,  little short of £1000. The success of the dry process has also been fully tested by Mr. M‘Nah of west nile Street, whose  eminence as a professional photographer is well known.  The modus operandi is this :——The artist starts in gig, dogheart, or otherwise, with his camera and also of prepared  plates. 0n reaching any choice bit of scenery, he descends, removes his camera to it, covers himself with a bag or sheet to exclude the light while the plates are being changed,  and an impression is forthwith taken, which is in due course brought home and fully developed in the laboratory, where everything is systematically arranged. Messers. Kibble E;   M’Nab made their ﬁrst trials of this plan by going to Dumfries, whence they drove to the charming hit of country at and around Sweetheart Abbey, whence they brought away six—perfect plates, each presenting different views of great  beauty—some of them being lovely bits of rural scenery which struck the 'fancy of the artists as they drove along the road. But the greatest effort was at the head of the Gareloch, where, by an ingenious improvement, principally his own, he took the sea with its curled waves, the most magnificent clouds that were ever transferred, along with shore, houses, and scenery —the whole forming a picture of unsurpassed accuracy and beauty. More than this, in another picture he has taken the sea waves and fixed a steamer on his plate though passing-along at the rate. of 12 miles an hour; and the outline of the Arron hills  is distinctly seen, though at the time they were taken they were forty miles distant from the camera. This gentleman has also produced some magniﬁcent portraits, two feet in length, which were transferred while the lens stood forty two feet four inches from the subject; and in some of his incursions into cloudland, he has brought away an impression after the plate had only been exposed for the  forty second part of a second. Altogether we look for great improvements in the art from the research and enthusiasm of such an intelligent amateur. While on this subject, we may allude to Mr. M‘Nab’s gallery, which contains the very ﬁnest photographic coloured specimen’s we have seen at any time or place. . He has succeeded,we observe, in extending very small daguerreotypes, or glass photographs, into large and most perfect pictures. From a faded miniature or photograph, of not more than two inches in diameter, we have seen this artist produce an unimpeachable picture, varying in size from 16 to 18 inches in diameter. Indeed, all this gentleman’s views and likenesses are brought out with a degree of freshness, sharpness, delicacy, and ﬁnish which we have not seen anywhere surpassed. "No speak thus strongly after having seen in the gallery-the portraits of a large number of our most eminent citisens, with the members of their families, male and female, old and young.

The first general meeting of the Newcastle-upon-Tyne and North of England Photographic Society was held at 28, New Bridge Street, on Friday evening, Mr. George Christopher Wanner, one of the vice-presidents in the chair. Mr Joseph Fraser McKie, hon. Sex., read a detailed account of the organization and establishment of the society, also its constitution, and list of officers for the present year, which elicited the hearty plaudits of all present. The Chairman then read a paper entitled, “photography as it is” The following is a brief extract:— This being, he said, the first paper read before the society, he did not propose to bring before them any new process, but rather to give an account of the present state of the art, and show that photography was not confined to mere portraiture or depicting of landscape scenery; he also stated that the art had reached such a degree of the importance that no less than four journals were now devoted solely to disseminating photographic information. Numerous societies, now exist, and are instrumental in bringing forward improvements in the various processes of the art, and in bringing to bear the knowledge and experience of many of the most noted scientific men of the day in their several vocations. The various societies have obtained the patronage of men of rank and fortune. At the meeting of these societies we find discussed every subject connected with the art, comprising chemistry, optics, mechanics &c. Mention was made of the various modifications made in the several processes during the last few years, particularly with respect to the various dry methods lately introduced. In special mention was made of a new lens invented by Mrs. Sutton, whereby a picture embracing a much larger angle of view than the ordinary view lens is capable of producing can be taken. Reference was then made to the various new printing processes for insuring permanency and stability, the present mode of printing with silver salts being vy every honest photographer considered unsatisfactory. This part of the paper was illustrated by specimens of various kinds of photographic carbon printing and engraving. Reference was made to the application of photography to wood engraving lithography &c. And special notice was made of a patent process for obtaining photographs on glass and ceramic ware, requiring to be burnt in a furnace for the purpose of fixing. A specimen of this process was introduced. Amongst other applications mention was made of its use in astronomical observations for registering the variations of the thermometer, barometer, and magnetic needle. It was also useful to the architect, the engineer, the microscopist, the military profession, &c. It was also stated that photography was being used in the Ordnance Office at Southampton for reducing the ordaining surveys and that by the use of the art for this purpose saying to the country of 30,00 will be affected. Towards the conclusion of the paper, reference was made to the influence of the art on the artistic taste of the public. He glanced at several useful applications of photography, showing that it is by o means confined to portraiture, but that its sphere of usefulness is very large. In conclusion, he said, if each member gave an occasional paper, or statement of either failures or successes in any branch of the art, or even put a few questions as to the why and wherefore of anything connected with it, he has no doubt they would always be able to pass off a pleasant instructive, and amusing evening. At the close of the paper an animated conversation took place, which lasted some time. The rest of the evening was spent in examining some fine large photographs kindly supplied by Messrs, Laws, North, and Warren. Mr. Laws presented two proofs of his very beautiful views of the Ruins of Tynemouth Priory for the portfolio of the society. A vote of thanks was given to Mr. Laws. The thanks of the meeting was also given to Mr. Warren for his excellent and interesting paper. The next meeting will be held on the first Friday in March.

 The following letter in the Times appears to deserve' attention : “I seek to warn photographers in general of the great risk they run in the use of a certain salt, the cyanide of potassium. in their a orations. My attention was called to the subject has by observing in some of the papers on account, taken from a Cape journal. of a Dr. Atherstone. who was dreadfully injured—in fact all but killed——by the effects of this deadly poison. which came in contact with the blood through some slight scratches on his ﬁngers . The effect was instantaneous,and as everyone who has read the account knows the most alarming symptoms followed. Now, this might easily happen to anyone else. A man using this solution forgets some little scratch on his ﬁnger. And by accident. a drop falls on the place; in a moment the poison ﬂies 20 through his veins and the work of destruction is accomplished before the unfortunate sufferer has time to think of or obtain. an antidote. There are two things I would especially draw attention to: That the use of this salt is in my opinion, unpardonable because there is a perfect substitute for it namely, the hyposulphite of soda. which has besides an advantage. The cyanide, in ﬁxing the photograph, will, if not poured off at the right moment dissolve away the picture itself this can never happen with the hyposulphite. There is but one idle excuse that can be pleaded for the preside—viz., that it requires rather less care and trouble in washing it off after ﬁxing than the soda solution. as to taking off stains of nitrate of  silver, this can be done without incurring the terrible risk of such an accident as happened to Dr. Atherstone by moistening the spot ﬁrst with a strong solution of iodide of potassium, then with dilute nitric acid. and washing afterwards with hyposulphite of soda. Last but not least,I would pull attention to the great want of caution in placing this salt in the hands of persons unacquainted with its dangerous properties. Sets of photographic apparatus. with chymicals, books of instructions &c. complete. are now very generally sold at prices of three ﬁve. and ten guineas and upwards. I bought one of those myself and found it answer very well; but now comes the point which I would entreat persons who are amusing themselves in this art, or whose friends or children are doing so. to observe—Among the chemicals is a bottle labelled (as I know for a fact) only “ Fixing solution.” Now. who is to know whether it is the cyanide or the hyposulphite' In my nose it was the cyanide and it is so most generally. In the book of instructions the proportions for making this solution are given without the slightest mention of its poisonous qualities, and without even mentioning the hyposulphite as a substitute. There is also a book published by one of the ﬁrst photographie establishments in London. in which this salt is prescribed in two operations ﬁrst in cleaning the plate and then as before in the ﬁxing process: but in both cases without any caution as to its use. It is absolutely - unnecessary in the cleaning. as ammonia will do equally well. I will just mention what happened to myself, and which roves the danger there is. In that very operation—viz., cleaning the plate—I cut my finger—i suppose with the edge of the glass, but did not perceive it till I saw drops of blood on the cloth. Now, sir, I would just ask the gentlemen who publish the book what would have happened had had I been following their directions as the cleaning plates? If what I have said may be the means of cautioning persons from using (as is very generally done by amateurs, especially ladies) solutions without knowing that they are, I trust you will not think your valuable space wasted.

Court-house, before J. H. Shaw and E. Irwin, Esqrs., a  young man, named Amos Lambert, appeared to answer a  summons charging him with having, on Sunday last, fol lowed his ordinary calling by taking and selling photographic likenesses. Mr. Ferns, who appeared for the defendant, said he was not instructed to deny the facts stated  by the police ofﬁcer; but he contended that his client was not following his ordinary calling on the Sabbath-day, inasmuch as he was a woodcarver by trade, and practised photography as an amateur; but even supposing it to be his ordinary calling, he (Mr. Ferns) would submit to the bench that it was not a case for interference because no harm whatever could arise from likeness-taking on a Sunday. Indeed, it very often happened that artists obtained sittings of a Sunday. After a short consultation, Mr. Shaw said that the bench had no doubt whatever that the taking  of photographic likenesses had been made a part of Amos Lambert’s ordinary daily calling. If a person chose to knowl two or three occupations, each was his “ordinary calling.” But the difﬁculty experienced by the bench was whether a photographic artist came within the meaning- of the word “ artiﬁcer ” in the Act of Parliament. The words  were :—“ No tradesmen, artiﬁcer. workman, labourer. or other person whatsoever, can exercise their ordinary calling on the Lord’s day.” The words, “ or other person whatsoever must mean of the same description as those mentioned before; they could not extend to other classes, that was quite clear. That being so, the question was simply what was the meaning of the word “artiﬁcer,” and if it included artists? In the “ imperial Dictionary ” the word artiﬁcer meant artist ; and turning to the word art, he found that it including mechanical skill. If the case could be heard at the sessions, he should have thought that the best course would be to raise the question there, by the bench inﬂicting a small penalty, so that an appeal might be made. But there was no appeal from the decision of the magistrates, and as they were anxious not to go short of the law, or to go beyond it, they should allow the question to stand over till they had an opportunity of consulting  the recorder, or some other person of eminence, on the point whether the practice of phonography came within the meaning of the Act of Parliament—Leeds Mercury.

On monday evening, T.A. Malone, Esq., F.C.S. delivered the first of two lectures before the members of the literary and philosophical society, on “photography”: its present condition and most important applications”. As early as 1802, Wedgwood, a relative of the celebrated potter, made experiments with nitrate of silver on paper, by which he produced representations of some objects Sir Humphry Davy also took the matter up, but their great difficulty was to find some chemical that would fix the picture. The matter rested till 1814, when Davy tried chloride of silver instead of nitrate to sensitize the paper. This was an improvement, but the paper was not found to be sufficiently sensitive to fix the images of the camera obscura. By the aid of the solar microscope, Davy succeeded in obtaining a picture of the wing of an insect, but still he was unable to fix his picture, and so the matter was again allowed to drop. In 1839 however, it was found that ammonia, cyanide of potassium, r hyposulphite soda, would any of them fix the image by destroying the sensitive properties of the chloride of silver. While these experiments were being made in England, a M. Niespe, in France, was also trying to fix images of the camera. His idea was to cause a black surface to become white by the action of light. He did not however, succeed in producing any striking results. In 1829, he was introduced to Daguerre, who was also making experiments. The two agreed to pursue their investigations together. In a few years, Niepce died, and the experiment were continued by Daguerre and a relative of his deceased co-operator till 1839, when the Daguerreotype was announced. The experiments were performed on metal plates, covered with white of egg, and rendered sensitive by chloride of silver. The action of light hardened the egg, but produced no image. Aquafortis was then applied to the plates, which acted upon the parts not hardened, and so etched the plate. At the same time the Daguerre announced his discovery, Mr. Fox Talbot published the result of his experiments, which were on paper. Iodine wa then first used by Daguerre, who prepared his plates with iodide of silver. They were placed in the camera, and when taken out no change could be seen to have taken plate, but on placing them over the vapour of mercury, a picture was developed. Talbot developed this latent image by gallic acid. About this time, a Mr. Archer began using collodion in the place of white of egg, and it was found that it increased if anything, the sensitiveness of the plate. From that time,great progress had been made in al branched os art, which he would notice in the next lecture. On Tuesday evening, the greater part of the lecture was devoted to an explanation of the method now generally adopted by photographers to obtain pictures on glass/ This is accomplished by the aid of a film of collodion, which, after being dipped into a bath containing nitrate of silver, becomes extremely sensible to the action of light. All the details connected with obtaining images of this class in the camera and also the methods of making, testing, and using the chemical agents employed, were entered into at length, and their applicatio rendered very clear, even to a general audience. The lecturer indeed, apologizes for the minuteness and technical character of some of these explanations, on the presumption that among his hearers some mature practitioners of this delightful art. At the close of the lecture, Mr. Malone made some remarks on the prospective advances of the art, in reference to pictures to be printed from copper plates and lithographic stones, some very curious and promising specimens of what had already been accomplished in that way being exhibited to the audience. With reference to the likelihood of ultimately obtaining the natural colour of an object in the photographic image, of which he might be expected to say something, he confessed that, from what as yet had been accomplished in that direction, his expectations were not very sanguine. The colours exhibited by the aid of the prism had, indeed, been obtained on metal plates; but these could not be rendered permanently distinct. In thanking the audience for their attention, the lecturer paid a compliment to Mr. Chadburn, as a manufacturer of the apparatus used by photographers whose merits were well non in London, and to whom he had been indebted for some illustrations of the utility of the art on a table before him.

Some time ago, we noticed, in this journal, the exquisite and life-like photographic portraits produced by Mr. Sarony, the eminent photographer, as this establishment in Blackett Street, in this town. Those great triumphs in the art were produced by the combination of what may well be called Mr. Sarony unrivalled skill in fixing, by means of some improved patented process, the photograph of the individual with life-like and symmetrical accuracy, and the artistic ability with which the photographs were coloured up to nature by the touches of the eminent portrait painters, whom he engaged. As regards the photographic process, it may be observed that the first stage of it is to obtain, on a piece of colodianied or prepared glass, a negative portrait, so called negative from the parts which are intended to be light being therein dark, and those light which in the finished portrait are intended to be dark. This negative appears to fulfill in photography the same province as the printers’ types, from which impressions may be taken at pleasure by the application of ink; and the photograph is taken by the agency of light, and contact and pressure are required in the case of both. In the photograph, the glass contained the negative is put in a wooden frame at the back of the glass, a piece of prepared paper is fastened in this frame with a slight pressure to keep it in contact with the negatively and, in a very short time, the action of the light through this negative produces a positive portrait on the paper, called positive from the parts which are dark on the negative being light on the positive, and those which are light being dark, besides that the sides of the face and body, which are reversed in the negative, are impressed in their true position in the positive. Hence the insufficiency of the process by which the negative is the only portrait taken and furnished to the sitter. In ordinary cases, the reversal may not be observed, but suppose the person to have a mark on the right side of the face, and to be mailed say in his left arm, the mark would appear in the negative to be on the left, and the maimed member on the right; and it is only by the production of the positive that this inversion can be remedied. It may be added that when the negative is once obtained any number of positive or correct impressions can be taken from it, varied in respect o darkness or lightness by the time during which the action of light is allowed to be exerted upon the two when in contact. Here we may remark the value of the patented process invented by Sarony. The great difficulty with photographers has been, while giving the face correctly, to give every part of the body also its corresponding symmetrical proportion. Where this is not done, the figure, especially the female figure, which depends so greatly upon the proportions being observed, is marred, so that, even though the features may be correctly taken, the full portrait must be called defective. This difficulty is completely removed by Mr. Sarony’s invention, and hence the correctness as well as high artistic skill of his figure. Then to his eminence is the photographic department in which he is allowed to be unrivalled, Mr. Sarony superadds the art of the portrait painter and we have more than once remarked upon the beautiful portraitures which have been the result. Up to this time, however, the relation between the two has been that the photographer has enlisted the aid of the artist; not the artist th aid of the photographic process. The relation, however, appears not unlikely now to be revered; and having noticed, Mr. Sarony in connection with photography, we have now to advert to miniature portrait painting in connection with Mr. Thomas Carrick, a gentleman of the metropolis, holding the highest place in that department, who has recently formed a connection with Mr. Sarony, for the purpose of taking his photographs and transforming them into pictures such as he produces with a faithfulness to the life and character and with an exquisiteness of finish, not surpassed, and, we believe, not equalled, by any painter of the present day. Mr. Carrick was of old well known in this town. But for the last eighteen years, he has resided in London, where he has achieved the highest reputation as a miniature portrait painter. Along with Sir William Ross and Mr. Thorburn, Mr. Carrick stood at the head of his profession, being, according to the universal acknowledgment, particularly remarkable for conveying character in his portraits. During his sojourn in London he has been a yearly exhibitor in the royal academy, where his portraits have attracted universal admiration and aided to give him both fame and success. Of this trio of famous miniature painters, the first-named is in a dying state, and the second has turned his attention to larger works, leaving Carrick still true to his art, but observant of what is passing around him, and, while wedded to miniature painting, not indis[osed to avail himself of all the aids which modern science might present as likely either to economise the labour or ensure the complete perfection of his art. By this time photography, which originally prdued only a dark unmeaning daub had reached that pitch of development of which Sarony has afforded so many beautiful exemplifications the colours and art of the artist had also been brought into requisition to render the portrait beautiful and life-like, as well as trhuthful; and the public have had ample opportunity of witnessing the successful result. It was while tis revolution in the art was progress in the metropolis as well as in the provinces, that a friend in this town, Mr. Joseph Armstrong, the ex-Sheriff, whose well-drawn portati in his official robes and visitors a Mr. Sarony’s show rooms have no doubt observed, suggested to Mr. Carrick the idea of basing his miniatures upon photography, it being reasonably argued that, if such excellent portraits were already produced in this way by far inferior hands, there were really no limits to the exquisite character of the miniatures which might be produced by his. The reply was a request to send up one or more of the photographs, in order that he might see what could be done with them The result was satisfactory; portraits of some private friends, prints beautifully prepared and printed for the purpose, were painted by Carrick. Although now satisfied of the value of photography, as a great, and, in fact, invaluable aid to miniature portrait painting, we can, nevertheless, imagine that is wa not without considerable reflection that the artist carries out the conclusion which it suggested. Idas of the dignity of the profession of which he had reached the head could not fail to obtrude; and, though the revolution in the art which was in progress might justify and even require such a step, he might not be insensible to the reflection that some of his contemporaries might regard the matter in a different light. Heretofore, although many beautiful portraits had been based upon photography, no artist of established reputation in London had gone at them; ad Carrick might well hesitate ere he sanctioned the change by his great example. Happily the spirit of the true artists, of whom excellence by every discovery of art of science is the motto, prevailed, and he had afterwards the satisfaction of knowing that his fellows of the Royal academy approved of the decision. Than Sarony, who is acknowledged to be an extraordinary photographer, the first miniature painter of the day could not desire or hope to find a more fitting colleague. The result of negotiations was an agreement between these two first rate men in their kindred departments under which Mr. Carrick has been engaged for the last two months in Newcastle, exerting his inimitable art upon a number of Sarony’s best photographs taken in this town after completing which he proceeds to Scarborough, where Sarony is now engaged. Some of these portraits, both of ladies and gentlemen connected with this town and neighbourhood, as finished by Mr. Carrick, we have seen; and nothing can be more faithful as portraits or beautiful as works of art. They are, in fact, such gems as probably only this alliance between the painter and the photographer could produced. As to the advantage of the union to both, as well as to the public, it is perhaps unnecessary to go much into detail; By the photograph a faithful portrait is at once obtained, upon which the artist may exert his skill; and with not more than two or three sittings, and at a third part probably of the cost which otherwise it would be, produced a miniature of exquisite beauty and unequalled faithfulness. In the portraits which we have seen the photograph appears to be thoroughly painted out, and the miniature to be as delicately manipulated as it can possible be, and with no doubt all the more success, from the fact that the attention to the artists is concentrated, not so much in forming the portrait, as in bringing out the portrait supplied by photography to his hand. Under the manipulation and the features and the form appear to live in the portrait; and character and expression are given to the features which can be little more than hinted at in the photograph. In the painting of the drapey of the female form, the use of photography to the artist is particularly noticeable; and in this way, while animation and character are given to the face, an ease and grace are imparted to the figure which were otherwise attainable, if attainable at all, only at the expenditure of great labor and much time. It is thus, we are happy to know, with the utmost satisfaction and success, that the famed miniature painter, who now brings to the task the accumulated skill and experience of thirty years, is engaged in the consummation of this new era in the art of miniature portraiture. To both Mr. Sarony and himself it may be hoped it will prove a gainful one; while to the public it must be equally advantageous, in placing unrivalled portraits at their disposal at a third part of the chaos at which miniature portraits, and those probably less perfect, have hitherto been obtained.

We have had before us some results of a new process by which photographic negatives are taken on glass —to be afterwards transferred to paper, by means of a lens, on an increased scale—that transcend of the kind which the art has yet produced. The discovery was met with in Paris by Mr Mayall who brought it over to this country and sets his face against all patenting of secrets which tend to the advancement of art. The specimens which we have seen are intended for the Palace of Glass; but in the meantime Mr Mayall proposes to publish in our columns for the benefit of all practitioners, the particulars of a process which carries the art of spontaneous translation to a point on which it is difficult to imagine an advance. The value of this process is enhanced by the capacity to enlarge, by the application of a magnifying power, the dimensions of the image produced on the negative plate. In this way, without creating to the traveller the embarrassment of extra luggage, he may make his negatives on aas small as scale as may be convenient, reserving to himself the choice of producing at a future time positives of such dimensions as he may desire. For topography and transcription of the peculiarities and minute details of architecture and costume, this discovery will prove of great value. There are in the impressions resulting from this process a clearness and sharpness of definition in the architectural subjects such as we have never before seen. Some calotypes from the hands of Mr. Thomas Elmore that we have examined privately made the nearest approach to the excellence herer reached. The impressions that we have looked at are, as we have said wonderful for their perspicuity and truth. In a view of the portico of the Madeline, as seen from the Rue Royale, the details of the tympanum, the frieze, the capitals, the bases, the shafts, the tympanum,, the frieze, the capitals, the bases, the shafts, the inscriptions, the bas-reliefs, seen through a magnifying glass at our side are extraordinary. The rendering of the bas-relief in the pediment is most perfect. Two views of the Salle de la Convention are marvellous to the naked eye; through the lens they reeval details which will provoke the admiration of the architect. When the process shall be devoted to high examples of Greek practice, we doubt not it may be made to record with unfailing truth subjects hitherto imperfectly known. The Porte St Denis is another example of wonderful truth-telling even to the minutiae of the inscription ‘Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.” The view of the Arsenal is as dominie sampson would say “prodigious!” Never was seen such perfection of detail. The subject is striking and novel. The foreground composed of the rectilinearly arranged masses of shot, gun carriages, and the men actively engaged in their duties, were just the objects to text the fidelity of gaged in their duties were just the objects to test the fidelity of this highly sensitive medium. The artist may throw down his brush in despair. No human eye or hand can trace from the objects themselves within any moderate degree of accuracy such details. The following is the process by which the negatives on glass were taken as furnished to us by Mr. Mayall. First the albumen of a fresh egg must be beating into a snow like mass with a bunch of quills, dropping into it ten drops of a

We have has an opportunity of examining a number of specimens of photographic portraits, the production of Mr Bilbo of Sauchiehall Street. In these portraits which are from glass on paper, Mr. Bilbo has, with considerable success, attempted to produce such broad effects of light and shadow as are usually wrought with China ink, and therefore from the grained ground of his pictures, they seem rather at a little distance to be aquatint engravings. In some of his works which we have seen as for instance a coloured portrait of a little boy th effect is quite artistic and the management of the rights and shadows is almost all that could be desired. We must, however, in justice to Mr. Bibo inform him that in our opinion, we do not think that the style he has chosen will be popular. The most of persons prefer the sharp[ detail of photographic pictures and the hazy outline and harmony of tint which Mr. Bibo produces will not satisfy such microscopic observers. Before he can catch the million he will have to sacrifice something to the prevailing taste.

The most wonderful discovery of modern times will go down to posterity associated with the name of Daguerre but that illustrious gentleman is no more fully entitled to originate the term for the new department of photography than was Americanus to give a name to the New World. In 1802 Mr. Wedgwood, the celebrated manufacturers of porcelain published in the journals of the royal institution an account of a method of copying paintings upon glass and of making profiles by the agency of light upon nitrate of silver with observations by sir humphry davy. This was decidedly the birth of the discovery. Subsequently, and in the same year, M. Charles delivered a series of lectures in Paris in which he endeavoured to show and we believe, exhibited in illustration, the production of images on prepared paper by the agency of light. The experiments were, however, so crude and the failures so frequent that M. Charles received little or no encouragement for the furtherance of his novel invention. Still more signal were the failures in england of sir humphry davy and wedgwood. The results of their experiments discouraged any further attempts at that period in making advanced in the new discover in this country. Even in France, where philosophy is more enterprising and persevering than with us, we learn nothing more of the photographic inventing till in 1814 M. Niepce by means of the camera obscura, discovered the peculiar chemical properties of light in changing the solubility of organic substances. This gentleman, however, at the very outset was defeated in his desires of bringing the new discovery to any profitable issue. It is not until ten years after we meet with any further elucidation of the photographic arcana. M. Daguerre instituted a series of experiments in 1824, and in 1826 we find him, in conjunction with M. Niepce directing his efforts to the new agencies of light. Several pictures on metal plates were in 1827 submitted to the royal society of london by m niepce when he was in england. These pictures were merely in the state of advanced etchings. In 1829 M. Niepce produced spontaneously, by the action of light, images with gradations of tints from black to white by means of the camera obscura. To the new discovery he employed on the plate to prepare it for reception of the solar rays was iodine, which, he says, possesses the property of evaporating at the ordinary temperature. Upon this tint M. Daguerre acted. He materially modified and improved the heliographic process, which was tedious and uncertain. In 1829 m daguerre completed his discovery, and specimens were shown at paris, which excited that attention of the learned, and called forth the admiration of all beholders. In the present advanced state of the art, when improvement has made such rapid strides, especially within the last year, when Mr. Beard’s principles of coloration invest the pictures will all the beauty of the choicest miniatures in oil and when the gloss of novelty is worn off, M. Daguerre’s specimens elicit neither surprise nor wonder. Our country still further disputes with france in its claims for the discovery of that minute process of photogenic art which bears the name of M. Daguerre. In 1839, Mr. Henry Fox talbot read before the royal society a paper entitled  some account of the art of photogenic drawing or the process by which natural objects may be made to delineate themselves without the aid of the artists pencil. From this date to 1844. The art seemed to have remained at a stand still. Thus we have given a concise history of this extraordinary discovery up to the period when mr. Bread obtained his patent. But, notwithstanding the beauty of finish, fidelity of outline, and the fixation of the most minute and delicate details which might have been observed in Mr. Beard’s first pictures, still there was much wanted to render the likeness palpable, if we may so express it, to the person taken. We all fancy ourselves much better looking than we really are —it is a universal foible of our natures and being accustomed to see most resemblances flattered, super adding a rose to the cheek, or a coral to the lip, rendering the forehead more lofty and the brows more arched, or borrowing from the imagination only the gracious curls to shade the temples were never curl sported before, the very fidelity of the likeness would become a bar to approval and when it is added that the impression of the countenance taken by the first photogenic process presented a completion assimilating itself in hue to the pallor of death is may be readily allowed that the objections against the daguerreotype were neither few nor uncalled for. Mr. beard in 1843 and 1844, made many discoveries which greatly facilitated the fixation of the image on the plate, and further improved the process of receiving impressions by radiation. In conversation with sir john Herschel, mr. beard was led to suppose that only the intensity of the images but the different colorations of the chemical impressions produced by radiation might be obtained to this mr. beard applied his attention with unwearied assiduity for two years, and though his endeavours have as yet produced no coloured images, at least beyond a few prominent shades, he does not consider the hope of effecting it at some subsequent period as altogether illusive. In his experiments one discovery resulted which no less than one we shall presently mention tends to elevate his likenesses to their present state of completion. Mr Beard, by a process of preparing his plate entirely different form all that had been hitherto tired was able to obtain a far more perfect picture than had been previously taken, under any circumstances whatever, Not only the tones of the face but as he calls them the semi-tones, were, by the new method, transferred with astonishing minuteness and accuracy to the plate. In this point alone the present impressions are vastly superior to all former daguerreotypes as may be seen at any of mr. beard’s establishments, where are exhibited in contrast pictures after the old and new mode. The former, compared to the latter, it will be seen, are no more than finished etchings and do not show one half their tints and shades. Mr. Beard, not being able to discover a process by which he might fix the colours of the radiated solar rays, it occurred to him that some substitute might be used, and he turned his thoughts at once to transferring the colours to the plate after the image was fixed by radiation. The adding the colour when the picture was taken may seem easy enough to such as do not understand the photogenic process; but when we take into consideration the extraordinary delicacy with which the likeness is impressed, when we remember that a single touch would obliterate the image entirely, the fact of fixing the colours to such evanescent tracing seems to us no less wonderful than the discovery of photography itself. Mr. beard has now triumphed over every difficulty. The likeness obtained after his late improvements is now indeed a veritable reflection of the face and the impression obtained, in point of apparent execution of the closest fidelity with respect to lineament and facial peculiarity, far surpasses the most exquisite miniature painted by the most elaborate pencil of the greatest artist. Photography is, indeed, the grand discovery of the nineteenth century, and Mr. Beard more truly deserves than all his predecessors the name of discoverer of the modern photogenic miniature.

process of photography, or sun painting.  the history and details of m. daguerre's photographic process were communicated by m. arago to the academy of sciences of paris, at the sitting of the 19th instant; from which it appears that in prosecuting his labours m. daguerre was assisted by a m. niepce, deceased, with whom the discovery originated. the french government has therefore awarded a pension to the surviving son of m.  niepce, as well as to m. daguerre, in return for the publication of the process. soon after the announcement of m. daguerre's invention, a claim to the merit of the discovery was made on behalf of m. niepce by his friend m. bauer, who showed specimens of the new art produced by m. niepce in 1827 : and, what is more extraordinary still, m. niepce possessed the means of taking "impressions from his sun graven plates, and m. bauer has some impressions from photographic engraved pictures. we made no allusion to this statement of m. bauer at the time, preferring to wait till the rival claims were settled: there is now no longer a doubt that m. niepce originated the invention, which m. daguerre has perfected so far as ﬁxing the picture on the plate only, not in taking impressions from it. m. daguerre's recipe is as follows :  — a. copperplate plated with silver, its surface well cleansed with dilated  nitric acid, is exposed to the action of the vapour of iodine: . this forms the ﬁrst coating, or ground, which is inconceivably  thin, and requires to be perfectly even. the plate . thus prepared is placed on the table of the camera obscura; and after remaining eight or ten minutes — according as the subject 'or the degree of light may require — is withdrawn: at this stage of the process, however, the most practised eye will not discern the slightest trace of the action of the light on the prepared surface. the plate is then exposed, in a proper apparatus, to the vapour of mercury; and when heated to 60 degrees, the picture appears as if by magic. a singular, and hitherto inexplicable circumstance, requires to be noticed in reference to this part of the recess— — that the plate must be in an inclined position; and that if it he placed directly opposite the aperture whence the vapour of the mercury escapes, the result will not be satisfactory. lastly, the plate must be dipped in hyposulphite of soda, and afterwards well sluiced with distilled water; the operation is then complete the cost of the plate must necessarily be considerable, and  the chemical process requires nicety and skill; so that the expense of the photographic pictures will not. be so triﬂing as might be supposed, especially when accidental failures are taken into account. by this process, it is to be borne in mind, the picture appears on the plate  as it does on the disc of the camera that is, with its forms and shadows painted dark on a white ground. in the simpler process invented by m r. fox talbot, by which the solar rays act on the prepared paper, called photogenic, the light and shades of the real objects are reversed, and the picture is painted white on a dark ground. mr. talbot's method of preparing photogenic or sensitive paper consists in washing tfme writing paper over ﬁrst with a solution of nitrate of silver,. then with bromide of potassium, and afterwards with nitrate of silver again, drying it at the ﬁre after each operation. he also imitates etching on copperplate, by smearing over a piece of glass with a solution of resin in turpentine, and blackening it by the smoke of a candle: on, this ground the design is traced with the point of an etching needle, and the sensitive paper being placed behind the glass exposed to the sun’s the rays of light passing through the transparent lines, not upon the paper, and leave the design imprinted in a brown hue. the experiment can be repeated as often as may be desired. this last mentioned process, however, is but printing by sun light from etching on glass: it is on enough, but nothing compared to the drawings of light, where nature delineates her own image reversed onto paper; and this again is far inferior to the beautiful perfection of m. daguerre's process, by which the external picture is depicted in miniature, light for light and shade for to the minutest gradation of each — only colourless.
